# express-ready
This project is made for node.js beginner. I've started using express.js framework and using EJS for view engine thus easier for HTML migration. How to use EJS read this tutorial https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-ejs-to-template-your-node-application

It is ready to connect to MySql database and I've used JWT for secure our API.  I hope you enjoy using express-ready. We are welcome everybody to improve our repo.   

Thank you.
