# express-ready
This project is made for node.js beginner. I've started using express.js framework and using EJS for view engine thus easier for HTML migration.   It is ready to connect to MySql database and I've used JWT for secure our API.  I hope you enjoy using express-ready. We are welcome everybody to improve our repo.   Thank you.
