# express-ready
This project is made for node.js beginner. I've started using express.js framework and using EJS for view engine thus easier for HTML migration. How to use EJS read this tutorial https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-ejs-to-template-your-node-application

# Installation
If you are not install node.js on your machine https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/ohoterz/express-ready.git
$ cd express-ready
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```
Try http://localhost:8080 on your browser.

It is ready to connect to MySql database and I've used JWT to secure our API.  I hope you enjoy using express-ready. 

We are welcome everybody to improve our repo.   
Thank you.
